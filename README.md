# API Specifications

This repository contains API specifications (openAPI, GraphQL, etc.) for public APIs. The goal is to provide a central location for API specifications that can be used by developers, testers, and other stakeholders to understand the capabilities of the APIs.

## OpenAPI Specifications

OpenAPI specifications are available in the `openapi` directory. Each API specification is stored in a separate directory under the `openapi` directory. The directory structure varies depending on the API hierarchy and versioning. For example, the OpenAPI specification for the `googleapis/docs` API is stored as follows:

```
openapi
└── googleapis
    └── docs
        └── icon.png
        └── v1
            └── openapi.yaml
```
